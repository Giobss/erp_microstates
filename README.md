# micro-pred
This repository contains scripts used to analyze EEG microstate data for prediction of categorical (matlab file: ERPclassification_genalg.m) and dimensional outcome (VABSregression_microstates.R).

OF note: 
1) names of files and folders have been cancelled, so the scripts need to be readapted
2) the matlab script is the main for classification, but the classification function is called from a separate script
